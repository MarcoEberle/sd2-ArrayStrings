# ArrayStrings

This is my solution to the assignment **ArrayStrings** of class **software developement 1**, written in Java.

### Requirements

This program consists of three classes: Interface **StringTable** that represents a contract for a StringTable with multiple methods.
Class **ArrayStringTable** is a String table made of a simple Array. Class **ListStringTable** is a String table made of an ArrayList.
Both are implementing the Interface StringTable.

#### Class ArrayStringTable and ListStringTable

Both can return a specific element in the StringTable, move one element to a different place or replace one element with another.
